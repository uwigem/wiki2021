Our human practices subteams communicated frequently through email and met online through Zoom on July 22nd, August 6th, and September 3rd to discuss how our human practices teams could benefit each others' projects.</p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>7/22/2021</strong></span></h5>\n<p>During this meeting, we introduced ourselves and shared our current progress on our respective projects. We were able to learn more about the context of FDR_HB's project through this meeting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Their project is to create a solution for rapid, in-field detection of cadmium for use in the cacao farming industry, due to the elevated concentrations of cadmium present in potassium-rich fertilizers. Their ideal product would be a dipstick that utilizes cadmium-chelating proteins. Their current solution was designed as a live-culture shaking incubator that would provide information about cadmium presence after a lengthy duration of incubation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once we contextualized their team's project, our human practices team was able to relay FDR_HB's needs to our lab subteams to see if they were able to assist FDR_HB.</p>\n<h5><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;\"><strong>8/5/2021</strong></span>&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>During this meeting, our teams discussed how our human practices needs could be met by the other.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>FDR_HB was in need of a mathematical modeling mentor, so our team provided a high-level overview of our modeling process to their math modeling lead. In addition, our wetlab subteam was able to troubleshoot and provide feedback about the potential use of a dipstick assay. Lastly, Washington iGEM's human practices subteam was able to communicate with our stakeholders to determine whether a rapid-time assay similar to the eventual product FDR_HB iGEM would create would be of use in a large-scale remediation setting.</li>\n<li>Washington iGEM was in need of feedback from stakeholders in the agricultural industry to determine if RhizoMet could be feasibly implemented in the agricultural industry. Our team was also able to request Spanish-speaking translators for Washington iGEM's sister organization Synbio for Everyone.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>9/3/2021</strong></span></h5>\n<p>During this meeting, our human practices teams met to provide updates.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>FDR_HB:</strong> \"This past Wednesday we have been able to meet with the people the FDR_HB team is currently in contact with in regard to cacao, and we have asked them if there may be an arsenic issue in the soil. They, unfortunately, answered that they believe that there is no significant issue, but they did mention that there are many other heavy metals that have found their way into the soil, and may therefore be of concern.\"</p>\n<p>Although there was no significant presence of arsenic in the soil in the Peruvian cacao industry, the confirmation that FDR_HB's stakeholders gave indicated that RhizoMet had a potential future application in the agricultural industry.</p>\n<p><strong>Washington iGEM: </strong>\"Although cadmium is not the main driver of remediation within the town of Northport, WA, there may be other opportunities to implement a rapid-time cadmium-detection assay in other industrial smelting sites in Washington, such as in the Everett or Tacoma ASARCO smelter sites. Heavy metal concentrations are elevated in all areas of these remediation sites, so selectivity is not needed during remediation, but a cadmium-detection assay could be used to quickly verify that sites are cadmium-free after initial remediation.\"</p>\n<p>Without this collaboration, Washington iGEM's human practices team would not have been able to access information from FDR_HB's stakeholders and we would not have been able to fully examine the implications of our project.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\n"

We arranged a zoom meeting between our mathematical modeling teams in which we described how we started creating our kinetic models. We described how we first started learning more about kinetic modeling by finding published models, examining the equations they use, and using that experience to learn about how to build our own models. We also described to them about how we were building our kinetic model based off of a specific paper, \"Mechansitic Modeling of Genetic Circuits for ArsR Arsenic Regulation\" by Dr. Berset and colleagues. Through sharing this with them, we encouraged FDR_HB's math modeling team to start looking for published models that have similar aspects to their proposed project design. We also discussed how we were having issues with finding parameters for our model due to not having lab access. Additionally, FDR_HB also asked us about what program we were using for our model, so we introduced them to the python environment which we used, Tellurium.</p>\n<p>This opportunity to give advice to FDR_HB was also an excellent opportunity for our team because we wished to gain more experience with teaching others how to create synthetic biology models. In order to help others learn how to model synthetic biology systems, we created a tutorial video on how to use Tellurium, a python environment that is designed for modeling synthetic biology systems. In order to improve our tutorial video, we decided to sent FDR_HB our video and asked them to give us feedback on what we could improve. The video file that we sent them is located below.</p>\n"

From the meeting, we learnt that the results of our intended experiments would go a long way in improving our respective project design. FDR_HB is interested in designing a heavy metal accumulation system within yeast. This coincides with the ongoing experimental plan Washington has to verify the efficacy of our arsenic accumulation system within E.coli that involves the co-expression of a transport protein and a modified metallothionein. Thus Washington iGEM has agreed to share our results with FDR_HB Washington and this information could help FDR_HB to decide if they would like to co-express transport protein with a metal sequestering protein for their metal accumulation design. On the other hand, Washington iGEM is keen on eventually having our proteins be expressed under the control of a constitutive promoter. This is similar to the current design of the cell free detection system FDR_HB, and they have also referred us to the 2020 Puerto Rico iGEM team project design for further inspiration. Hence we believe that the verification of their plasmid design would also be beneficial to Washington iGEM eventually.</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"> </span></p>\n"

Preliminary findings shows that the modified MTIA results in similar arsenic tolerance as wildtype MTIA and wildtype 4MT2, hence while further experimentations are required, there is great promise in the ability of the modified MTIA to sequester arsenic at a greater capacity. he details regarding drylab and wetlab experimentations with the modified MTIA are well documented in our wiki and the part registry (linked in section heading). The documentation could provide useful information on the both the wildtype and modified versions of th protein for furture use by other teams.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align:left;\">glpF:</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">We intended to express glpF in our arsenic remediation system to mitigate the limiting effects of transport of arsenite into <em>E.coli</em>.

From the preliminrary findings, the addition of glpF to increase transport of Arsenite into E.coli did not decrease bacteria tolerance to the heavy metal. This eliminates the concern that coexpressing glpF and therefore increasing Arsenite concentration in E.coli would reduce E.coli tolerance towards Arsenite and result in a reduced capacity for arsenite remediation. Thus this finding bodes well for future experimentations by Washington iGEM or other teams keen on trying this particular bicistronic construct for arsenite remediation.&nbsp;</p>\n"

However, currently unsustainable industry practices leave behind toxic metals like arsenic and lead which are retained in the environment for up to 9000 years [2]. Arsenic is one of the main contributors to heavy metal pollution in industrial and post-industrial regions globally, with at least 140 million people in 50 countries consuming arsenic-contaminated waters at concentrations above the WHO provisional guideline value of 10 μg/L [3]. In general, the outcome of arsenic smelting practices is the release of arsenic waste products which have increased the prevalence of arsenic poisoning across the world, with acute symptoms of gastric distress and long-term carcinogenic effects [3]. In more extreme cases like the town of Northport Washington, located in the Upper Columbia River region, residents have reported alarmingly high rates of Ulcerative Colitis, among other ailments [4]. Currently, the mining industry is only growing to accommodate for industrializing economies around the world. In China, manufacturing equipment sales reached a peak revenue in 2019 of $73.8 billion [5]. Current methods for remediating contaminated land often involve soil containment and relocation, but these solutions only temporarily postpone the symptoms originated by contaminated soils. Therefore, the lack of more permanent methods for detoxifying and remediating areas affected by the mining and smelting industry is not only crucial for restoring environments that have been affected in the past but also for promoting the health of residents and ecosystems that continue to be affected by these prominent industries.</p>\n"

Moreover, throughout the process we struggled to locate a space to conduct laboratory experiments as in-person lab work at our university was restricted to strictly necessary causes and we were not able to locate lab space until September 2021. Thus, we decided to focus our efforts on modeling in order to compensate for the inability to conduct in-person experiments.

We started with designing our model by gaining familiarity with the python environment we were going to use for modeling, Tellurium. We also researched the proteins that are naturally present in bacteria that provide resistance and tolerance to arsenic. After it was decided that we were going to design our kinetic model around E. coli, we decided to look for arsenic accumulation models for E. coli. We found that the paper, \"Mechanistic Modeling of Genetic Circuits for ArsR Arsenic Regulation\" by Dr. Berset and colleagues described a model that had many of the equations that we needed to begin with designing our model [1]. We designed our own model which incorporated some equations from the paper by Dr. Berset and colleagues. We added to our model many equations unique to our solution, such as the binding of metallothionien to arsenic and the expression of GlpF from our plasmid. After designing our model, we built our model in python using Tellurium.</p>\n<p>Once our model was built, we began to test our model by running different simulations of the model. The simulations would vary by the time scale that was modeled and by what species in the model we would want to see the results of. Upon testing our model, we discovered one issue. The binding of arsenic to metallothionein was far lower than what we were expecting. When we had originally built our model, we decided to use reaction rates for the binding of arsenic to metallotionein based on the values obtained from arsenic binding to MT-IA as described by the paper \"Kinetic analysis of arsenic-metalation of human metallothionein: significance of the two-domain structure\" by Dr. Ngu and colleagues [2]. Upon testing our model, we realized that the parameters for the rate at which arsenic binds to metallothionein were far smaller than what we were expecting. The values were likely smaller than we wanted because MT-IA is does not naturally bind to arsenic well, which is why we our team designed a modified version of metallothionein. In order to obtain more suitable parameters, we had to go back to designing improved versions of our metallothionein binding to arsenic equations. However, we found that this was difficult because we had created our own verion of metallothionein, so it was not possible to find literature values for the binding parameters. Additonally, we did not have access to a lab to create an experiment ourselves to support what the binding rate parameters could be. As a result, we decided that we were going to have to try to find parameters that were somewhat close to our design. We decided to base our 2nd design of the metallothionein binding to arsenic equations on the paper \"The zinc balance: competitive zinc metalation of carbonic anhydrase and metallothionein 1A\" by Dr. Pinter and colleagues [3]. From this paper, we obtained values for binding rate constants of zinc binding to MT-IA. We chose to use this paper because our metallothionein was modified based on MT-IA and because 7 zinc bind to MT-IA and our modified MT binds to 7 As. We edited our model to have these new parameters. After building the model, we ran another simulation and found that our model predicted far higher rates of metallothionein binding to arsenic that was more aligned with the results we were expecting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall, the engineering cycle used in our kinetic modeling was: designing our model -&gt; building our model -&gt; testing our model -&gt; analyzing the results of the model -&gt; making improvements to the model. By going through this engineering cycle, we were able to make efficient progress in creating the modeling, testing the modeling, and improving the model.</p>\n"

Our project underwent many design changes before ultimately deciding to pursue our project of arsenic accumulation using rhizobacteria. In the spring of 2020, our team initially pursued a project focused on the accumulation of heavy metals from the human gut. Due to the prevalence of heavy metal poisoning from lead, arsenic, and cadmium around the world, we wanted to create a solution to this problem. We hoped to create a supplement that would contain modified lactobacilli bacteria which accumulate these toxic metals. Using modified proteins located inside the lactobacilli, the metals would be captured and excreted from the body as waste. Due to similarities in our project with PRODEACC, Team Lund's 2019 project, we hosted a meeting with Team Lund to discuss areas of improvement from their project and difficulties with the project. Our team faced difficulities finding mentorship in the field of study of probiotics, so we reached out to Dr. Mari Winkler for potential mentorship. Her lab focuses on waste water treatement of contaminates, including heavy metals.</p>\n<p>With further research, we realized our project only treated the symptoms of heavy metal toxicity and we decided we instead wanted to tackle the problem at its roots. We wanted to remove heavy metals from affected areas prior to human and animal consumption. Due to our connenction with the Winkler Lab, our lack of resources supporting our research with probiotics, and our shift in understanding of the bigger picture of heavy metal toxicity, we decided to shift our project focus onto metal accumulation in water.</p>\n<p>We began to design a water biofilm filter in order to accumulate heavy metals from water. We wanted to target our solution to helping the town of Northport, Washington, which has high amounts of heavy metal pollution. When researching how to best help to remediate Northport, we discovered that the heavy metal pollution was in the soil rather than in water. As a result, we decided to switch project designs to instead focus on designing a soil based remediation method.</p>\n<p>The design of our soil based project centers around the accumulation of arsenic from the soil using rhizobacteria. Our rhizobacteria will be modified to express a modified version of the protein metallothionein. <span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 16px;font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, \"Segoe UI\", Roboto;\">We designed our modified version of metallothionein so that it is specialized for binding to arsenic.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n"

We decided to use the MT1A human metallothionein protein sequence and the 4MT2 rat metallothionein protein as a template model for homology modeling. Despite the project’s transition into environmental metal accumulation, we decided to continue the protein modeling with mammalian proteins to ensure timely completion of the model. The modeling of the mammalian protein serves as a proof of concept for metal binding site modifications in metallothioneins, providing a foundation for future plant metallothioneins modifications.</span><br></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;\">Due to metallothioneins' nature of having many binding sites that bound to various metals, we wanted to take advantage of its many binding sites by modifying the protein to become more specific to binding Arsenic. In doing so, we are able to significantly increase the concentration of Arsenic accumulated by a single protein and by a single bacterial cell. Due to geometry and sequence adjustments made in the metal binding sites, mutations were made in the protein backbone to energetically stabilize the protein when bound to Arsenic. </span><br></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;\">Rosetta is not designed to model protein-metal interactions. Therefore when designing the protein we had to maintain a balance of stable protein energetics and reasonable distances for metal binding. This required fine-tuning the binding sites to maintain both stable energetics of the protein and keep amino acid-metal distances within a range of 2.23A - 2.33A. To engineer this protein with this balance of energy and distances in mind, we went through several iterations of the Relax. As mentioned in the Protein Modeling methodology description, we performed the Relax command several times in order to determine the best distance and angle constraints to use on the protein to satisfy the Arsenic’s binding geometry. This required small modifications to the distances and angles in the constraint file, running the relax command on our PDB file, then running get_metal_dists.py file to check the improvement in our distances and angles. While adjusting the distances, we also had to confirm that the protein's energetic stability was not worsening. On several occurrences, we ran into issues where the protein-metal distances closely matched Arsenic’s binding geometry, but the movement of the protein backbone created energetically unfavorable confirmations. Due to this balance that had to be maintained, we ran the relax command on several versions of the model to determine which models were energetically lowest prior to continuing our protein design. </span><br>&nbsp;</p>\n"

Bioremediation with whole cells has garnered traction recently as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution to heavy metal pollution. Hence, we intended to overexpress the protein in <em>E.coli</em> to investigate its effects on 1. E.coli tolerance to arsenite and 2. remediation of arsenite. Additionally, it has been reported that the transport of arsenite into cells is often a limiting factor to the amount of arsenite whole cell accumulators are able to sequester. Hence inspired by a study that showed co-expressing</span> <span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 16px;font-family: Arial;\">glpF, the protein responsible for bringing Arsenic into <em>E.coli</em>, and MT, does indeed improve accumulation, we constructed a similar bicistronic gene. Our gene construct contains an glpF codon sequence joined with the modified MTIA by a ribosome binding site (RBS), optimized manually for expression in <em>E.coli</em> with IDT codon optimization tool and Benchling.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 16px;font-family: Arial;\">Unfortunately, due to COVID restrictions, we did not have lab access until approximately a week before the wiki freeze deadline. Hence there was little testing that we could perform in person on our own. To maximize the amount of work we could get done before the wiki freeze, we outsourced a couple of experiments. Specifically, all genes were synthesized via IDT and we reached out to UW Biofab to perform transformation and plasmid verification. During our limited time in the lab, we sought to verify protein expression with SDS PAGE and the feasibility of our constructs (if it would increase toxicity for the host) with metal tolerance assays. We managed to run SDS PAGE 5 times, and each time we were able to learn from the previous result to modify and optimize experimental conditions. However for metal tolerance, we were only able to run it once as the materials required for the experiment only arrived a day before the wiki freeze. </span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 16px;font-family: Arial;\">Nevertheless, there were many take aways in terms of optimizing experimental designs for both experiments and subsequent experiments. Going forward, we would include a negative control to all our designs as this was overlooked in this round of experiments. We would also order a glpF gene from IDT and have that transformed into E.coli. Additionally, it would also be good if we could perform western blot to verify overexpression. All in all, the data we collected thus far are preliminary but nonetheless shows promise on the feasibility of our system design and of the intended function of the modified protein. </span></p>\n"

During our conversation, one key point stressed to our team was that of the 29 federally recognized tribes within Washington state, each one has different religion, history, and traditions of interaction with the environment.</p>\n<p>One plant Olsen discussed with us was the Camas plant, a native perennial flower that produces an edible bulb. She detailed her experiences and detailed her experience transplanting camas bulbs to be grown in the garden around the Burke Museum. Though many tribal liaisons were supportive of the introduction of camas into the soils of the Burke, it was stressed that one member from the Yakama Confederated Tribes disapproved of the transplantation of the camas plant into non-native soils. Therefore, in the search for our plant of choice, we would be wise to consider and choose a native plant.<br><br>Finally, our redesigned protein and bacteria chassis needed a way to remove the arsenic from the soil, and to then be removed from the soil itself. By reviewing literature, the symbiotic relationship between plants and root bacteria proved to be the most viable option. There were a few factors in narrowing down our plant(s) of choice: ideally, we needed a plant that is native, prolific, non-disruptive to indigenous populations, and climate-hardy.</p>\n<p>We began with a list of plants taken from an ongoing plant study in Northport. From that list, we identified 14 species that were abundant in the Upper Columbia Region.</p>\n<p>Next, we investigated/looked into the specific properties of each plant to identify a few potential candidates for our plant of choice. Our final plant candidates are all native, prolific, and climate hardy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Plant candidates:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lomatium Triternatum</li>\n<li>Bearberry</li>\n<li>Wild Rose</li>\n<li>Bracken fern</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>After considering the plant’s hardiness, native status, and prolificity, of these candidates, we chose to focus on Lomatium Triternatum (nine leaf biscuitroot), a member of the carrot family, due to its long taproot, the availability of literature available on inoculation of members of the Apiaceae family, and the absence of potentially adverse risk factors. (The bracken fern and bearberry all have a risk of being eaten by wildlife and risk recycling arsenic back into the food system).&nbsp;</p>\n"

[1] Although these metals are vital to our modern lives, the environmental, fiscal, and cultural impact of the smelting and refining processes required to extract metals from ore can not be understated. One such example of the dire impacts of this metal smelting and refining can be viewed in our team’s home state, Washington.</p>\n<p>Washington, the evergreen state, is known for its beautiful landscape, vibrant hiking trails, and lush forests. However, over the last century, metal smelters in Canada have released heavy metal waste emissions into the Upper Columbia River (UCR) region. The smelters emit aerosolized pollution that integrates itself into the soil over time, and as a consequence, the upper layer of mineral soil (1/2in - 2in deep) is contaminated with high levels of various heavy metals. A smaller smelter, the LeRoi smelter, in the region has also contributed to this pollution with the smelter processing 500 tons of ore a day at its peak of operation in the 1900s. [2]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Elapsing decades of operation, the continued extraction and processing of lead, zinc, copper, and other heavy metals from ore has affected not only towns near the border between Canada and the U.S. but also impacts the 1,245 miles of river, 260,452 square miles of land, and hundreds of thousands of people that the Columbia River watershed encompasses. [3]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our project aims to decrease heavy metal contamination in soil and thereby eliminate the detrimental effects on Northport residents. We are focusing on Arsenic, as different heavy metals require different approaches. For our project to be a success, we would need to design a protein that accomplishes this goal. We understand that solely designing the protein will not be enough, as there may be resistance from different people who are affected. Therefore, we also will need to gather support from a variety of stakeholders with different backgrounds and expertise. This will ensure that our solution can be implemented in industry without disrupting any other processes. The lower concentration of Arsenic in the soil will lead to better plant growth and decrease the amount of heavy metal poisoning for Indigenous and Northport residents. However, we realize that we would have to convince <span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 16px;\">Indigenous </span>and Northport residents that GMOs would be beneficial to them, and reduce the stigma associated with GMOs.</p>\n<p>At first, we planned on developing a probiotic that would absorb heavy metals in the gut, thereby preventing its detrimental effects on the body. We focused on lead, as that was the most abundant heavy metal at Northport, and had the most effect on the residents. We realized that this solution would end up sending the heavy metals back into the ecosystem through human waste. As we could not figure out how to solve that problem, we decided to pivot to removing heavy metals from the environment itself. This way, we had control of what to do with the heavy metals and could recycle/dispose of them properly. We first focused on heavy metals in water, as the Columbia River had a high concentration of lead. We thought of implementing a filtration system in the river with a lead-binding protein in biofilm but realized most of the heavy metals were on the river bed. However, we realized that we could use that filter on wastewater treatment systems. Those systems did not have an effective way of removing heavy metals before the water is released into the environment. If we were to implement such a filter, heavy metals would not pass through wastewater treatment systems.</p>\n<p>While this project was feasible, we realized that it did not solve Northport’s problem. They would not benefit from this project, and our goal, in the beginning, was to improve their lives. After speaking with Dr. Wichmann, we decided to pivot to a soil-based solution, as Northport’s contaminated soil was greatly affecting the residents as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n"

We reached out to professors and industry leaders in each of these fields in order to gain a better understanding of each area.</p>\n<p>Given the recency of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown, however, our team wanted our project to be centered around health and medicine.

Residents of Northport have been experiencing high rates of fatal and debilitating diseases, including but not limited to cancers, endocrine disorders, and Ulcerative Colitis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 16px;\">Many Northport residents were convinced that out of the 119 residents that participated in a 2011 health survey conducted by <strong>Joshua Korenzik MD</strong>,</span> <span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 16px;\">MD</span> <span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 16px;\">Director of the Crohn’s and Colitis Center at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, that 17 residents were confirmed to have Chrohn's or Ulcerative Colitis, two types of Irritable Bowel Disease (IBD). Korenzik stated: \"that’s about 10 to 15 times what we’d expect to see in a population the size of Northport. I’m not aware of any other cluster like it.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 16px;\">It was clear to our team that we had to address this issue of the increasingly apparent health concerns arising in Northport, WA. Though industrial air pollutants have been declining in recent years, the damage has already been done. Heavy metals such as arsenic still persist in the soil and water and were detected in 83% of the sediment samples, and samples exceeded acceptable levels in 32% of the cases in a recent survey conducted regarding the Northport waterfront. [CITE]</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Next, our team decided to consult <strong>Dr. Joe Wichmann</strong>, a technical advisor for the Northport remediation project commissioned by the EPA. We outlined our idea of a biofilm bioreactor, and he provided valuable feedback:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The main issue with heavy metals in the Columbia River is not in the water. Much of the heavy metal waste is diluted once it enters the Columbia River, so the target of our project should be eliminating heavy metals from the soil rather than water. The heavy metal emissions in the air are of lesser concern.</li>\n<li>Heavy metal contamination is contained to the upper 2 inches of mineral soil, so a soil-focused solution would need to penetrate the duff and other organic matter to reach the soil with the highest levels of contamination.</li>\n<li>The terrain and landscape of the UCR vary widely. The soil ranges from sandy waterfront soils to thicker woodland soils interrupted by boulders and covered by organic matter, so a soil-based solution would need to be agnostic to soil type.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, in Northport, the top few inches of mineral topsoil (not including the organic duff layer) include sandy soils that have been previously contaminated with lead via aerial dispersion from industrial smokestacks. Northport residents are contaminated primarily through activities such as gardening, digging, and ingestion/inhalation of soil. Afflicted soil encompasses traditional indigenous and private homeowner property.</p>\n<p>For residents of Northport, an ideal soil-based remediation solution would be a low-cost, low-effort (less effort than the off-site relocation of contaminated soil from residential properties) and minimally-disruptive solution that would be agnostic to soil-type that outcompetes other remediation methods to reduce lead bioavailability by &gt;35% from 650ppm down to &lt;250ppm (WA Dept of Ecology standards).</p>\n<p>With this contextual information established, our team decided to first conduct some background research on existing, in-use remediation solutions so that our team could gain familiarity with the target goals and metrics of remediation, and second to identify a solution that could be used to alleviate this problem.&nbsp;</p>\n"

//         "wysiwyg_content" : "<p>To begin, we researched 12 types of remediation to gain a foundational understanding of the methods and goals used in environmental remediation. Northport, WA has utilized off-site disposal and soil replacement to treat private residences and communal areas, but this remediation solution is expensive and difficult to coordinate. Some remediation techniques that have been commonly used include containment, pump-and-treat, extraction, stabilization/solidification, soil washing, air stripping, precipitation, vitrification, thermal desorption, and biological remediation, among other methods. Below is a summary of the twelve categories of remediation our team looked into derived from the Federal Remediation Techniques Roundtable (FRTR) [4] :</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Air stripping: volatile organic compounds are separated from groundwater by exposing large areas of contaminated water to air. Examples include packed towers, diffused aeration, tray aeration, and spray aeration.</li>\n<li>Biological remediation: bioremediation is a process in which indigenous or inoculated micro-organisms metabolize organic contaminants found in soil and/or groundwater, converting them to less harmful end products.</li>\n<li>Containment: containment treatments prevent or significantly reduce the migration of contaminants in soils or groundwater, necessary whenever contaminated materials are designated to be left in place at a site of remediation. An example of this is a landfill cap.</li>\n<li>Extraction (Chemical): the use of an acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid) or a solvent to dissolve heavy metals.</li>\n<li>Off-site disposal: contaminated material is removed and transported to an off-site treatment or disposal area.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Phytoremediation: a process that uses plants to remove, transfer, stabilize, and/or destroy organic or inorganic contaminants in soil and sediment.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Precipitation: this process transforms dissolved contaminants from a liquid into an insoluble solid, facilitating the contaminant's removal from the liquid through sedimentation or filtration. The process usually uses pH adjustment, the addition of a chemical precipitant, and flocculation.</li>\n<li>Pump-and-treat: pump-and-treat technology retrieves groundwater through the use of extraction wells, trenches, or galleries, treats the water in an above-ground treatment system, and subsequently discharges the treated water.</li>\n<li>Soil washing: contaminants adherent to fine soil particles are filtered from bulk soil on the basis of particle size through the use of an aqueous system. The washing liquid may be supplemented with a basic leaching agent, surfactant, pH adjustment, or chelating agent to help remove organics and heavy metals.</li>\n<li>Stabilization/solidification: Contaminants are physically bound or enclosed within a stabilized mass (solidification), or chemical reactions are induced between the stabilizing agent and contaminants to reduce their mobility (stabilization).</li>\n<li>Thermal desorption: Steam/hot air injection or electrical resistance/electromagnetic/fiber optic/radio frequency heating is used to increase the volatilization rate of semi-volatiles and facilitate extraction.</li>\n<li>Vitrification: vitrification uses an electric current to melt soil or other earthen materials at extremely high temperatures to trap most inorganics and destroy organic pollutants by pyrolysis. Inorganic pollutants are incorporated within the vitrified glass and crystalline mass. Water vapor and organic pyrolysis combustion products are captured in a hood, which draws the contaminants into an off-gas treatment system that removes particulates and other pollutants from the gas. The vitrification product is a chemically stable, leach-resistant, glass/crystalline material similar to obsidian or basalt rock. The process destroys and/or removes organic materials. Heavy metals are retained within the molten soil.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Among the 12 types of remediation we investigated, remediation methods, 4 (pump-and-treat, thermal desorption, air stripping, and precipitation) were unable to be applied in the problem space of Northport and other primary metal smelters due to their mode of contamination was largely non-soil based. An additional 4 (off-site disposal, chemical extraction, soil washing, and vitrification) were deemed to be infeasible due to the large scale of our project. leaving only 4 methods (phytoremediation, biological remediation, stabilization/solidification, and containment) as potential routes of remediation.</p>\n<p>Our team then began a more intensive review of phytoremediation, bioremediation, stabilization, and containment.</p>\n<p>Phytoremediation</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advantages</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Low-cost, self-propagating.</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Disadvantages</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Potential to be consumed by higher-level tropic organisms, so the choice of plant needs to be precise.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>Bioremediation</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advantages</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Low-cost, self-propagating.</li>\n<li>Easily cultured and inoculated.</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Disadvantages</li>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 16px;\">Potential to be displaced during variable conditions, intolerant of the cold.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>Stabilization/Solidification</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advantages</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Permanent</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Disadvantages</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Somewhat difficult to scale-up</li>\n<li>Restricts land use (unable to use the land for gardening, playgrounds, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>Containment</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin-left:1.5em;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 16px;\">Advantages</span></li>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin-left:3em;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 16px;\">Easy to scale-up</span></li>\n</ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 16px;\"> Disadvantages</span></li>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 16px;\">Restricts land use (unable to use the land for gardening, playgrounds, etc.)</span></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 16px;\">With this information, we decided that we liked the scalability of the phytoremediation and bioremediation technologies and decided to have a dual focus on phytoremediation and bacterial bioremediation by pursuing <strong>rhizoremediation </strong>since our team was already working on developing a <em>bacterial </em>gene construct. The plant incorporated into this rhizoremediation process would aid in the propagation of our rhizobacteria and help preserve the rhizobacteria during cold winter months with high levels of snowfall.</span></p>\n"

Finally, along with the diseases that arsenic exposure induces in humans, animals are also susceptible to cancer caused by arsenic exposure [3] and we envision that remediating the soil using native plants to sequester toxic forms of arsenic will reduce animals' exposure and help restore the native environment to the Upper Columbia Region.</p>\n"

After selecting such a plant, we will modify the bacteria in the rhizobium of the plant to sequester toxic forms of arsenic which cause disease and ailment to the residents of the region. To accomplish this goal, we will have to design the bacteria to use proteins which will bind to toxic forms of arsenic such that they are no longer bioavailable in the soil and therefore no longer able to inflict harm on people or the environment. After designing such a protein, we will verify the stability and model the impacts on the cell and surroundings. This will give us confidence in our design and allow us to judiciously perform experiments utilizing our design that further verify the metal binding ability and uptake of our modifed organism. Due to constraints regarding lab access and COVID-19 protocols, it is necessary to focus our efforts on modeling the feasibility of our design rather than relying heavily on experimental verification. Next, after we have created the modified organism which can uptake and sequest arsenic at above average rates, we will need to transform the plant root bacteria to contain our organism. Finally, with this step completed we can begin to test the effects on soil in isolated lab environments by culturing these transformed plants and measuring the arsenic content of the soil. After conducting these experiments and examining the effects on surrounding plants and organisms, we would present our findings to local officials and residents and propose the implementation of our remediation solution. We would continue to incorporate feedback and follow all regulatory guideslines for our project. If residential and governmental support was found for our genetically modified remediation, we would begin planting and testing our system in a small and controlled area of the Upper Columbia Region.&nbsp;</p>\n"

The release of our organism into the environment could integrate into, proliferate, and disrupt natural ecosystems. As a result of this, locals in the vicinity of our organism could be directly affected by the organism and its waste products. For example, engineered bacteria may integrate themselves into water supplies and cause water-borne illnesses. Additionally, crop health may be affected by our engineered organism if native rhizobacterial populations are supplanted by our chosen organism. While this is absolutely not our intent, we plan to use extreme measures of caution to avoid all scenarios in which accidental harm could be caused from the release of our project. First, w</span>e recognize that safety poses an enormous challenge for the real world implementation of our project. Thus, in order to set reasonable expectations about the use of our project, we will conduct thorough testing in contained and isolated lab environments to demonstrate the safety of our engineered plants and the associated rhizobacteria before any in situ experiments are ever performed. Moreover, we recognize that thorough discourse with and support from residents and local government is mandatory to progressing with the implementation of our project, as ultimately, we do not want to force our solution to be used in places where it is not desired. Further still, we know that genetically engineered organisms are subject to strict oversight by the FDA, EPA, and USDA in the United States. As such, we plan to fully abide by the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology as established by the US government to oversee the safety of genetically engineered organisms such as our own [1]. Our in lab work will also be overseen by experts such as Dr. <span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;\">Liangcai Gu from the UW Department of Biochemistry, </span>and each participating lab member has received full training on <span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;\">proper BSL-1 guidelines and safety regulations.</span> Finally, while constructing the proof of concept of our project,<span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;\"> we have decided to use E. coli as a model organism.

The transcription rate of mcherry was estimated based on a transcription rate of 12 amino acids per second and mcherry being 236 amino acids long [12]. The maturation rate of mcherry was obtained from \"A guide to choosing fluorescent proteins\" by Nathan Shaner, Paul Steinbach, and Roger Tsien [6]. When building the model for plasmid 3, we were not able to find a good parameter for the degradation of mcherry. As such, we decided to analyze the results of the model as it is now without a degradation rate equation. However, the lack of a degradation rate means that our model is likely not as accurate over longer time intervals. In the future, if we wanted to analzye our plasmid 3 model over a longer time interval, we would have to find a suitable parameter for the mcherry degradation rate.</p>\n"

After revealing the binding sites, we can study the amino acids that interact with the metals and the potential modifications to binding affinity to Arsenic instead of Cadmium and Zinc. Due to the differences between binding sites for Arsenic, Cadmium, and Zinc, we will simulate point mutations changing the extra coordinating amino acids to non-interactive ones to eliminate the previous interactions. We also want to optimize the binding affinity by simulating point mutations at the sites that will cause the protein and Arsenic to form more stable binding conformations, with the end goal of implementing these mutations in Wetlab to design an Arsenic binding protein with high affinity, allowing better accumulation and removal of arsenic in the environment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Modelling protein structure is a complex and difficult problem. Due to the difficulty in lab access during the pandemic, we were not able to use more precise “imaging” techniques, like x-ray crystallography or electron microscopy, to examine its structure (nor do we have the resources to undergo these tests). Therefore, we rely solely on simulations and their energy outputs to understand our protein’s structure. To simulate our protein’s structure, the metal binding, and to mutate our backbone protein, we used a software suite developed at the University of Washington called Rosetta. We chose this platform because its wide range of functions suits our needs, and we can easily get support for it at our university.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, simulating the protein’s structure introduces some uncertainty and variability, which is problematic because it is harder for us to predict how exactly our protein and metals bind. There are several ways each atom in the protein can interact with each other, and each of these must be considered since they may influence the overall protein structure. We use energy output as a measure of how close the protein is to its most stable state, but it is difficult to pinpoint the exact model that will lead to the lowest energy conformation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the structure simulation, Rosetta randomly folds the protein one residue at a time, discarding folds that increase the total energy of the protein and keeping ones that decrease the energy. However, depending on how Rosetta initially folds the protein, when it finishes going through the entire sequence, it does not always reach the lowest energy conformation possible. Out of potentially infinite local energy minima there is only one general energy minimum, which is the one we want. When Rosetta tries to minimize the energy, the final fold will likely be one of several local energy minima rather than the lowest energy model that is the most accurate. We can try to find this by generating hundreds of models and analyzing only the few with the lowest energies.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Another word for a sensitivity analysis is a parameter scan. A parameter has a high sensitivity if small changes to the parameter result in large changes to the model.

We found a simulation of 100,000 seconds sufficient to provide a visual approximation of steady state.</p>\n<p>Since our project created a modified version of the protein metallothionein, it is difficult to accurately predict related kinetic modeling parameters, like the arsenic binding rate and protein degradation rate. For example, it was difficult for us to determine what degradation of metallothionein to use because the half life of metallothionein can range from less than 3 minutes for monkey and mouse MT to 50 minutes for a fusion MT protein analyzed in the paper \"Bioaccumulation of heavy metals in Escherichia coli expressing an inducible synthetic human metallothionein gene\" by Dr. Romeyer and colleages [4] [13]. The results of our sensitivity analysis on the degradation rate of MT (kdMT) are shown in Figure 14 and Figure 15. In order to analyze the effects of changing parameters on our model, we graphed how variation in kdMT affects the amount of free arsenic in the cell (Figure 14) and how variation in kdMT affects the total arsenic in the cell (Figure 15). The total arsenic in the cell is equal to the amount of free arsenic plus the amount of arsenic bound to MT and arsR in the cell.</p>\n"

In addition to sequence information for the protein, homology modeling uses template proteins to guide the folding process in Rosetta. The accuracy of the models simulated by Rosetta depends on the similarity of the template structures and the number of gaps in the sequences. The more gaps in the templates, the more Rosetta must construct on its own, leading to a lot more variability in the homology models. Templates with high homology lead to faster convergence of the protein of interest’s structure.</p>\n<p>We preferred homology modeling to Rosetta’s other structure predicting protocol called de novo modeling. Instead of using templates to guide the folding process, de novo starts from just the amino acid sequence and uses Monte Carlo simulations to fold the protein. The individual models are less converged and less accurate than homology models as de novo must start from scratch each time, so this process is generally very inefficient. We recommend 50,000-100,000 models to see convergence, while for homology modeling, we only need about 100-200. However, de novo simulations on supercomputers could be useful if there are no similar structures available for the protein of interest, or if the homology models are suspected of relying too much on the templates.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h6>An overview of the homology modeling:</h6>\n"

Because we were not able to have access to a lab when working on the model, we were not able to use lab work to obtain any parameter values. As a result, our parameters were either obtained from literature sources or were roughly estimated based on literature information. Some of the most difficult parameters for us to obtain were the synthesis and degradation rates for the proteins in our model. The synthesis rates of GlpF and MT were estimated using a translation rate of 12 amino acids per second. The rate of 12 amino acids per second was selected because it matched well with the translation rate constants from the paper we based our model on, \"Mechanistic Modeling of Genetic Circuits for ArsR Arsenic Regulation\"[1], and it is within the range of translation rates found in the paper, \"Polypeptide-chain-elongation rate in Escherichia coli B/r as a function of growth rate\" by Ry Young and Hans Bremer [2] . Additionally, because we created a new version of metallothionein, there are no literature values that exist that are perfectly applicable for us to estimate the binding rates of our MT to arsenic. As a result, we decided to estimate these parameters based on the binding rates of human MT-IA to zinc [3]. We also had to make an estimation of what the degradation rate of our MT would be. After searching for literature values of the degradation of metallothioneins in E. coli, we found that monkey and mouse MT degrades in E. coli with a half-life of less than 3 minutes and that yeast MT degrades in E. coli with a half-life of 15 minutes [4]. Because our MT was modified based on human MT-IA, we wanted to use a degradation value based on a mammalian MT. Our MT was modified to improve its stability over what might be expected of a wild type mamalian MT in E. coli. As a result, we decided to base our MT degradation off of the average of these two degradation rates and decided to base our degradation rate off of a 9 minute half-life.</p>\n"

However, upon examining the results of the model of plasmid 2, it was found that the concentration of MT with seven arsenic produced by this model was not reasonable for the amount of a protein that could be produced within E. coli. We drew two conclusions from these results. First, we concluded that the transcription rates of the T7 promotor used in our model may be higher than what would naturally occur in E. coli. This is likely because it is difficult to find parameters and models that would well fit our design. The second conclusion that we drew from this is it is likely that encorporating the T7 promoter into our plasmid would indeed mass produce our desired proteins, which would be ideal for any Wetlab experiments that are done that require mass amounts of our desired protein in the cells. However, if our Wetlab finds that many of their E. coli are not surviving well or that they are having difficulty isolating the proteins, then this can be explained by our model results that the T7 promoter may result in the production of too many proteins in the cell. If this occurs, then we would recommend that Wetlab decreases the number of plasmids used in their experiments. The results also indicate the importance of controlling plasmid expression using arsR in our implimented rhizobacteria design. Without controlled expression, the rhizobacteria would produce our proteins even in the absence of As, which would cause the bacteria to use resources to make proteins that are not needed, and this may lead to a decreased survival rate of our bacteria.</p>\n"

Therefore, in order for our model to support wetlab experiments and for our model to recieve data from wetlab experiments, we decided to develop our model based on E. coli. After developing our project goals and design, we decided to model the kinetics of a plasmid containg the proteins arsR, a transcription factor repressor which represses transcription in the absence of arsenic, GlpF, a transport protein that allows As(III) to enter the cell, and our modified Metallothionein. Additionally, our model incorporated the E. coli chromosome ars operon, which contains arsR, arsB, which is an arsenic efflux pump, and arsC, which is an arsenic reductase enzyme that converts As(V) to As(III).

We can do this by taking our model and analyzing the interactions between the protein and the metal. In Rosetta, due to the differences in optimal binding sites for Arsenic versus the cadmium and zinc that the human Metallothionein naturally binds to, we first simulated point mutations changing the extra coordinating amino acids, specifically cysteines residues, to non-interactive alanine residues to eliminate the previous amino acid-metal interactions and allow better arsenic binding. Cadmium and Zinc coordinating geometries require 4 cysteine residues in a tetrahedral shape. Arsenic’s coordinating geometry requires 3 cysteine residues, also in a tetrahedral shape, the 4th location containing a lone pair of electrons. The mutation into alanine residue, the side chain is a hydrogen molecule, which will also decrease the energy of the structure of the backbone protein. Then we inserted point mutations in the amino acid sequence of the protein and simulate different combinations of mutations to find a conformation with the lowest energy. This energy state indicates the strongest binding between protein and metal, which would increase the effectiveness of arsenic accumulation from the environment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h6>Overview of Protein Design:</h6>\n<ol>\n<li>Align metals and copy to best homology model pdb file</li>\n<li>Make point mutations (Cys -&gt; Ala)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Relax 10x with constraint file</li>\n<li>Measure energies via score file</li>\n<li>Measure protein-metal distances</li>\n<li>Repeat steps 3-5 until best contraints for constaint file are determined&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Design on the lowest energy model from relax at residues that may improve the overall energetics of the model</li>\n<li>Relax all designed pdb models</li>\n<li>Measure energies and distances&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Choose the best mutations that decrease energy and improve distances.</li>\n</ol>\n"

The concentrations of As3, MT, and MTAs_7 are almost identical between our model with arsR and our model without ArsR. As a result, we were able to see that removing arsB had a minimal effect on the overall accumulation of As, thus we advised our Wetlab that it was not necessary to eliminate arsB from the E. coli chromosome. By making these models, we were able to save Wetlab experimental time as we were able to confirm that the presence of arsB would not interfere with any experiements they conduct, such as metal tolerance assays or metal accumulation assays. Additionally, these models were able to influence our project design, as after making these models, we were able to determine that we do not need to use bacteria without arsenic efflux pumps, such as arsB, for our project.</p>\n"

After we mutated each residue individually (and checked for the positions that actually changed), we looked for the models that decreased the energy the most. We then used PyMOL to take a closer look at what was going on with the protein. Sometimes residues will mutate but end up adding additional unfavorable interaction with the metals. Thus, we eliminated these models from potential candidates to implement in Wetlab. Then we identified the specific residues that allowed lower energy and better stability and tried different combinations of the best mutations to see if we could decrease the energy further.</p>\n<p>After improving the binding geometry of Arsenic into the protein, we then improved the overall stability and energetics of the protein model. We created various mutations along the backbone of the MT protein to determine which mutations allow for the best improvement in energy. Mutations were created one position at a time to better evaluate the effect of each change to the whole structure. This was accomplished using a resfile, which outlines the mutation protocol for Rosetta. In the file, we specified which residues we wanted to mutate by their location, followed by a command indicating which amino acids we wanted to exclude from mutating at that position.

This amounts to between 13.3 and 255 milligrams of As III removed from a kg of soil with unlimited concentrations of As III. This conversion is shown in the figure above. We attribute the high variation of this range to the uncertainty brought from the degradation and synthesis rates of our custom MT protein which we cannot experimentally derive. We also recognize that the assumption of unlimited external arsenic has a large effect on the true remediation potential. However, while the result is a broad range, we believe that the minimum value represented, 13.3 mg of As remediated from a kg of soil, is still enough to have a profound impact on the wellbeing of surrounding residents living in arsenic contaminated soils. This is shown by the fact that the soil in Northport contains a range of 14.5 and 67 mg of arsenite per kg of soil. Conservatively removing 13.3 mg would represent a roughly 20% improvement in the worst case, and a roughly 91% improvement in the best case of the Northport soil concentrations. Therefore, our model predictions give us confidence that even the minimum amount of arsenic that we predict we could remediate from Northport’s soil would be a significant improvement on the health of their residents and the surrounding environment.</span></p>\n"

Plasmid 1, shown in Figure 8, is similar to our single cell model, so our plasmid 1 model was made to be a copy of our single cell model. Plasmid 2, shown in Figure 9, has a different promoter than plasmid 1. Plasmid 1 uses a Pars promoter, which is the same promoter used in our single cell model that is controlled by arsR. Plasmid 2 instead uses a T7 promoter which is not controlled by arsR, but is instead consitutively expressed at a high level of expression. Plasmid 3, shown in Figure 10, uses a Pars promoter similarly to plasmid 1, however, the gene for mcherry, a red fluorescent protein, was added to the plasmid.&nbsp;</p>\n"

The X axis plots the Arsenite concentrations in mM and the Y axis plots the viability in %. There is a clear trend showing as the Arsenite concentration increased, the bacteria viability decreased. There seems to be a significant drop in viability at 4mM of Arsenite.

This means that we are on the right track to getting our accurate results since there was no decrease in tolerance. Something interesting that was also observed is that all bacteria with GlpF increased in tolerance compared to without GlpF. This was surprising because we expected Arsenic to not be sequestered by Metalothionein. However, since there could be Metallothionein limiting and due to the influx of Arsenic into the E. coli, the tolerance could have increased. This result was unexpected and will warrant further investigation. Overall, the modified protein did not decrease in metal tolerance and shows that our team is on the right track to getting a higher metal tolerance. </span>&nbsp;</p>\n"
