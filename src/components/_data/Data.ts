In systems biology he has developed a number of software tools, and standards most recently a Python based kit called Tellurium. He was cofounder of the SBML development teach. His modeling research involves developing new robust methods to develop more reliable predictive models that can simulate diseases such as cancer. Recently, he was appointed to lead a large Center for Reproducible Biomedical Modeling which was also recently awarded by the NIH.",

		NAME: "Dr. Liangcai Gu",
		BIO: "Dr. Gu's lab use quantitative protein interaction profiling to understand molecular recognition and guide computational protein design. They develop protein interaction sequencing technologies by coupling ‘protein barcoding’ techniques—e.g., molecular attachment of proteins to barcoding DNAs, display of proteins on phage or cell surfaces, and indirect barcoding of unlabeled proteins by using DNA barcoded affinity reagents such as antibodies—to massively parallel 'in situ DNA sequencing' to quantitate protein interactions at a single-molecule or single-cell level. One example of protein interaction sequencing is a single-molecular-interaction sequencing (SMI-seq) technology (Gu, et al., Nature, 2014) for large-scale molecular counting of proteins and complexes. Our current research interests include (1) engineering of ligand-responsive protein assemblies, (2) human protein interactome profiling and drug screening, and (3) functional profiling of B-cell and T-cell receptors.",
